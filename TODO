compile warnings:

Q.c: In function ‘main’:
Q.c:466:17: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
Q.c:478:13: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]

Also, you have binaries
have Q.c.swp and .Makefile.swp files
We also probably should remove the "old" directory from the distribution

    Q_FILE=path -- Required.  The path to the Q queue state file.  More info below.

It's not required.

How do I define and hard-code stuff from make? I.E:

make CFLAGS="-DCOMMAND=sleep"

need in Makefile:
   CFLAGS=""
   gcc -Wall -std=c99 -O3 -o Q Q.c abspath.c makedirs.c sebC.c ${CFLAGS}

We need a "make clean"

Also, when doing that, make seems to think that nothing needs to be done?

If we're going to add CFLAGS, maybe add LDFLAGS too?

After these changes, be sure to update the webpage too with the new HELP text.
