# You can use this to kill all Q instances:

# Good for visualizing polling:
for x in {1..4}; do VERBOSE=1 COMMAND=./sleeper.sh CONCURRENCY=1 ../Q 5 & done;

# Good for visualizing latency:
for x in {1..25}; do COMMAND=./sleeper.sh CONCURRENCY=1 ../Q 5 & done;

# A good-sized load spike (Runs in around 1.3 seconds):
sleep 3 && time (for x in {1..100}; do COMMAND=sleep CONCURRENCY=5 ../Q 0.05 & done; wait)

# DO NOT RUN ON WEBFACTION!  An extreme load spike (Takes around 3 minutes to run) -- The Linux kernel has issues with this one:
sleep 3 && time (for x in {1..2000}; do COMMAND=sleep CONCURRENCY=5 ../Q 0.5 & sleep 0.01; done; wait)
