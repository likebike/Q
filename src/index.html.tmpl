<h1><a href="b.html">What is Q?</a></h1>
<p>Q is a process queue specifically designed for running CGI and PHP at <a href="http://webfaction.com/">WebFaction</a>.</p>
<p>Normally, CGI and PHP at WebFaction are great, except for one problem: there is no limit to the number of CGI workers that can get created.  So during a traffic spike, it is easy to exceed your account's RAM limits, resulting in all your processes getting killed.  FastCGI is often recommended as an alternative because it allows you to specify the number of worker processes that should be created.  Unfortunately, due to some problems with Apache's FastCGI module, many sites produce intermittent "500" errors, or stop responding altogether.  As a result, neither the CGI mode, nor the FastCGI mode is really acceptable for sites that need very high reliability.</p>
<p>Q fixes this problem by only allowing a defined number of CGI workers to run concurrently.  Any additional requests that come in get queued and execute in FIFO order.  This enables you to easily control the maximum amount of RAM you use during traffic spikes.  This solution makes CGI a viable option again.</p>
<p>Q is developed by <a href="mailto:csebastian3@gmail.com">Christopher Sebastian</a> and <a href="mailto:ryan@ryansanden.com">Ryan Sanden</a> (both of whom work at WebFaction).  Feel free to ask us questions and send feedback.</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Installation consists of two pieces: downloading a Q binary, and then referencing the binary from your website's .htaccess file.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In all of the below instructions, make the following name substitutaions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class=mono>APP</span> = Your Application Name, defined in the WebFaction Control Panel, and corresponding to a folder under <span class=mono>~/webapps/</span>.</li>
      <li><span class=mono>Q.cgi</span> = The actual filename that you download from the table below (probably <span class=mono>php54_normal.cgi</span>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Download an appropriate binary, give it a proper set of permissions, and place it at <span class=mono>~/webapps/APP/</span>.  You can do this from the command line like this:</p>
<pre class=code>
cd ~/webapps/APP/
curl -O http://q.likebike.org/bin/centos6/Q.cgi    ${'#'}${'#'}# Replace this URL with the appropriate one from the table below.
chmod 755 Q.cgi
</pre>

    <h3>If your account is on a CentOS 6 server (Web300 or higher):</h3>
    ${self.DL_TABLE('CentOS 6', '/bin/centos6')}
    <h3>If your account is on a CentOS 5 server (Web299 or lower):</h3>
    ${self.DL_TABLE('CentOS 5', '/bin/centos5')}
    <p>Here is a link to the <a href="${latestURL}">latest source code</a>.  You can also browse the <a href="/bin">distribution mirror</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Edit your <span class=mono>~/webapps/APP/.htaccess</span> file and add these lines to the top of the file.  Remember to replace both instances of <span class=mono>Q.cgi</span> with the actual file you downloaded:</p>
<pre class=code>
&lt;FilesMatch ^Q.cgi$&gt;
    SetHandler cgi-script
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
Action php-q /Q.cgi
&lt;FilesMatch \.php$&gt;
    SetHandler php-q
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</pre>
    <p>That's it!  Once you save these changes, your site will be running from Q!</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>If you have a question that is not addressed here, please send it to <a href="mailto:csebastian3@gmail.com">Christopher</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Which PHP version am I running?</h3>
    <p>Create an <span class=mono>info.php</span> file in your web app with the following contents:</p>
<pre class=code>
&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
</pre>
    <p>When you visit that page, the PHP version will be printed at the top of the screen.  Remember to delete the info.php file when you are done with it so other people can't see your settings!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>What is the difference between the "normal" and "large" binaries?</h3>
    <p>They are configured to run different numbers of concurrent processes.  The "normal" settings are appropriate for basic WebFaction accounts, and the "large" settings are better for accounts with more RAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>I am using Q, but I forgot which one I downloaded.  How can I see which Q settings I am currently using?</h3>
    <p>Run your Q binary with the <span class=mono>HELP=1</span> environment defined, as shown below.  The resulting help message will list your settings.</p>
<pre class=code>
HELP=1 ./Q.cgi
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>How Q Works</h1>
<div class=exampleContainer>
  <div class=exampleSidebar>
    <p>This example introduces how to use <span class=progName>Q</span> as a general process queue tool.  This mode of operation is very flexible and powerful, and ideal for interactive, command-line-based tasks.</p>
    <p>Two <span class=progName>Q</span> options are introduced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class=mono>COMMAND</span> -- The path to the target command.  (The only required parameter.)</li>
      <li><span class=mono>CONCURRENCY</span> -- The number of processes to run simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Example #1: Running <span class=mono>N</span> Processes at at Time</h2>
  <p>Pretend that you have a program named <span class=progName>SWAAG</span>, which converts <a href="input.png">images</a> to <a href="output.txt">ASCII art</a>.  The generation of this ASCII art is very CPU-intensive, but not demanding in terms of RAM or Disk I/O.  <span class=progName>SWAAG</span> is single-threaded and synchronous, so it only uses one CPU core when it runs.  Also pretend that your computer has 4 CPU cores, but you only want to use 3 of them for ASCII art conversions.  (You need the other core for YouTube, of course!)  You have a directory with 100 images that you need to convert, named <span class=mono>image00.png</span> to <span class=mono>image99.png</span>.</p>
  <p><span class=progName>Q</span> makes these kinds of tasks easy.  You would just need to type this <span class=progName>bash</span> command:</p>
<pre class=code>\
for image in image*.png; do
    COMMAND=swaag CONCURRENCY=3 ./Q "$image" --charmap ascii_extended
done
</pre>
  <p>Here are some graphical views of the execution (click to enlarge):</p>
  <a href="${self.URL('/static/img/q_ex1_sys_view_1024.png')}"><img src="${self.URL('/static/img/q_ex1_sys_view_500.png')}"></a>
  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/400x248/000/fff">
  <p>There are several phases of execution, as shown in the diagrams above:</p>
  <h3>The <span class=mono>START</span> Phase:</h3>
  <h3>The <span class=mono>QUEUEING</span> Phase:</h3>
  <h3>The <span class=mono>EXECUTING</span> Phase:</h3>
  <h3>The <span class=mono>END</span> Phase:</h3>
    <p>This is the point right before you type the above command and press <span class=mono>ENTER</span>.  At this point, no <span class=progName>Q</span> or <span class=progName>SWAAG</span> processes are running.</p>

<pre class=code>

Q Version 1.1.0  --  a FIFO worker queue, capable of running multiple workers at once.

Typical usage:  COMMAND=/usr/bin/rsync  ./Q  [args...]

The args get passed directly to COMMAND.

Environment Variables:

    COMMAND=path -- Required.  The path to the target executable.  Should usually be an absolute path.
    Q_FILE=path -- Required.  The path to the Q queue state file.  More info below.
    CONCURRENCY=num -- Controls the number of workers to run at once.  Default is 1.
    MAX_Q=num -- Controls the maximum queue size (# waiting to run).  Default is -1 (unlimited).
    AUTO_CREATE_DIRS -- Set to 0 to prevent the Q_FILE parent directories from being auto-created.
    VERBOSE -- Set to 1 to display verbose information.
    HELP -- Set to 1 to display this help message and then exit.

You can use the tilde (~) and environment variables ($VAR) in the Q_FILE.
This enables you to achieve some interesting queuing structures:

    Q_FILE=example.Q                     # A relative path can queue jobs based on $PWD.
    Q_FILE=/tmp/shared.Q                 # A system-wide queue.  (You would need to chmod 666 it.)
    Q_FILE='~/myjobs.Q'                  # Use a per-account queue.
    Q_FILE='~/.tmp/Q/cgi_$SERVER_NAME.Q' # Assuming this is for CGI processes, use a per-domain queue.

<h1>Performance</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Q is implemented in C, and only depends on the C standard library.</li>
  <li>On a 32-bit system, a Q process uses around 400kB of RSS memory (most of which is from the standard C library, and therefore shared).  On a 64-bit system, a Q process uses around 630kB.</li>
  <li>Q uses Linux Record Locking for inter-process communication.  This method is very fast and it does not involve any filesystem activity, other than the one-time creation of a lockfile.</li>
  <li>Q uses intelligent binary search algorithms, along with other optimizations, to achieve excellent scalability and low-resources usage.  It is able to manage more processes than the Linux Kernel is currently able to handle.  (i.e. Q will never be the performance bottleneck.)</li>
